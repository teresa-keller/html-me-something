                    <p>My name is Teresa Beth Keller. I was born on June 22, 1981 in St. Louis, Missouri. My parents are Kevin and Sharon Keller and I have an older brother named Paul. I have lived in St. Louis my whole life. I graduated high school from Logos School in June 2000 and I spent one semester at Southeast Missouri State University in the fall of 2000. In 2012, I received my associates degree in Funeral Services Education from St. Louis Community College. Since there were no jobs in my field in the St. Louis area, I continued to work at Starbucks. I have never been married, but I have one son named Maxwell Broderick Keller.</p>

                    <h2>Maxwell Broderick Keller</h2>
                    <p>My son, Maxwell Broderick Keller, was born on April 12, 2001. I gave him the middle name Broderick after my paternal grandmother whose maiden name was Broderick. When Max was four months old, he contracted a virus that attacked his heart. He spent a lot off time in and out of the hospital his first year and relied on a feeding tube for nutrition until he was three. Max was on medication that kept his heart functioning somewhat normally. In June 2016, Max went into heart failure. On June 14, 2016, Max received a heart transplant at St. Louis Children's Hospital. He is doing well and has a healthy heart for the first time since he was an infant. Max loves Star Wars, Marvel, Transformers, and Nintendo games. He is my best friend and we spend a lot of our free time playing Pokemon Go.</p>

                    <h2>Vader<img src="C:\Users\tkell\lc101\html-me-something\Images\20160717_143710 (1).jpg " alt="Image of Vader" height="300" width="300"></h2>
                    <p>Vader is our family dog that we adopted from the Humane Society of St. Louis on January 20,2007. He is a miniature pinscher/chihuahua mix. The Humane Society thought he was about a year and a half old when we adopted him. They had given him the name Truman, but he did not respond to Truman and we did not really care for the name. Since he is a small dog, I wanted him to have a big, strong name. My son was really into Star Wars when we adopted our dog, so I tried calling him Vader and he responded instantly. He is not a typical small dog. He loves everyone he meets and he is not yappy.</p>
